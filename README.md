# Deepdriving

ensemble models to test ML in control environments and eventually implement an end-to-end model

## Autoencoder

The idea here is to test a variational autoencoder that can be used in full end-to-end driving.

## Image Segmentation

We're basically partitioning an image into it's corresponding segments with respect to objects or general image regions.
